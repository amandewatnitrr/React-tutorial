# Getting Started with ReactJs

<hr>

- JavaScript is a programming language that allows us as a developer to run logic in the browser. And the great thing about that logic in the browser is that it can do things that manipulate what the user sees. 
- JavaScript in the browser is able to manipulate to so-called Dom, the HTML elements that are rendered onto the screen. 
- We can manipulate this with JavaScript. And that allows us to change what the users sees without fetching a new HTML page. We don't need to request a new HTML page just to present something different to the user. So that's why JavaScript can help us. 
- And since React is a JavaScript library, it looks like it can also help us with that. It might be an extra building block, and indeed, React.js is a client-side JavaScript library. 
- It helps us with writing that client-side JavaScript code and it's all about building modern reactive user interfaces for websites.

## Building SPAs with ReactJs

- Now because thing get easier with React, and because we can build those rich user interfaces with React and JavaScript, when working with react, we often build so-called Single Page Applications.
- Because whilst we can use React to control parts of an HTML page, let's some interactive sidebar, and therefore we add a widget, you say to a page where a part of page is controlled with React. It is more common to control  the entire page with React. Which means we use react for everything we see on the screen and even for switching pages.

- Using JavaScript through ReactJs to change what's visible on the screen and that often leads to a smoother UI and a better user experience.

## ReactJs Alternatives

- React - <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/ReactJs-0088CC?style=for-the-badge&logo=React&logoColor=white">
  
  - This tutorial is about ReactJs but it is worth knowing that there are alternatives to ReactJs.
  - React is one of the most popular front-end frameworks or libraries, however, you want to call it.
  - It's a lean and focused component-based UI Library.
  - It really focuses on this component thing, and it doesn't have a lot of other features built in.
  - If you need other features like routing which we are, of course going to learn about in detail later on than you need to install a extra third party library.
  - And many a times it's very okay that we need to install third-party libraries to add certain pieces of functionality to your application because ReactJs itself really just focuses on these components, which we're going to learn about in detail later on.

- Angular - <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Angular-DD0031?style=for-the-badge&logo=Angular&logoColor=white">
  
  - Angular is another very important and very popular front-end framework.
  - Angular is a complete component-based UI framework. It also focuses on components just like ReactJs, but it ships more built-in features than ReactJs.
  - It also embraces <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-3178C6?style=plastic&logo=TypeScript&logoColor=white"/> right from the start.
  - It can be a overkill for smaller projects, therefoSSre since it has way more features built in.
  - But for a large project on the other hand, you don't need to rely on the community as much because there's more built into that framework.
  - The Syntax also looks different because whilst it is component focused, building these components works a bit differently with Angular than it does with ReactJS.
  
- Vue - <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Vue-7957D5?style=for-the-badge&logo=Vue.js&logoColor=white"/>
  
  - VueJs is kind of like the mixture of Angular and ReactJS, in b/w those 2 extremes, if you want to call it like this.
  - It's also a complete component-based UI framework.
  - Also, it also includes a lot of features, but bit less features than Angular but more than ReactJs.
  - It includes core features like Routing, for example and therefore with Vue we also have to rely less on the community.
