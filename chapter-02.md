# Creating a React Project

- To get started working on a ReactJs Project make sure you have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/"><img src ="https://img.shields.io/badge/NodeJs-339933?style=plastic&logo=nodejs&logoColor=white"/></a> installed on your system.
- Open the folder in the terminal where you want to create project and run the following commands:
-

    npx create-react-app react-application-name

- Also, make sure you don't have a prxy, firewall applied that might be blocking out your connection.
- Now as soon as the installation gets completed, run the following commands:
-
    
    cd react-application-name
    npm start

- This will automatically open the webpage on `localhost:3000` and you should see something similar as shown below:
